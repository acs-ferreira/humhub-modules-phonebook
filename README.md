# Description

A simple phonebook with Ajax Search
Based on the core module **Directory**

I've developed it for my personal use. 

First you have to change the fields displayed in the list here:
https://github.com/bumrufus/humhub-modules-phonebook/blob/6b938c00e2b361c1971bb9199bac2bd3962a9e75/views/index/index.php#L30-L39

and here:
https://github.com/bumrufus/humhub-modules-phonebook/blob/6b938c00e2b361c1971bb9199bac2bd3962a9e75/views/index/index.php#L97-L105

The fields are located here: **Administration -> Users -> Profiles -> _(select a)_ Profile -> Internal Name**

Sorry if it's not perfectly developed, but this is my first module :-)

## ToDo:

- [x] ~~cleanup the mess :-)~~
- [x] ~~remove the css ans js from the view files~~
- [x] ~~add translation~~
- [x] ~~add sort by field option~~
- [ ] load field titles directly from profile fields
- [ ] add a admin settings page to allow users to change the displayed fields and to change the sort order and pagesize
- [ ] add pagination option
