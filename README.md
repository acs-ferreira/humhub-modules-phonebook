# Description


Based on the core module directory

I've developed it for my personal use. First u have to change the fields displayed in the list -> u have to change it here:
https://github.com/bumrufus/humhub-modules-phonebook/blob/5cb48cfb1735451b1bff7b203169581e5cb2ffd3/views/index/index.php#L31-L38

and here:

https://github.com/bumrufus/humhub-modules-phonebook/blob/5cb48cfb1735451b1bff7b203169581e5cb2ffd3/views/index/index.php#L96-L104

The fields are located here: Administration -> Users -> Profiles -> select a Profile -> Internal Name

Sorry if it's not perfectly developed, but this is my first module :-)

# TODOS:

- ~~cleanup the mess :-)~~
- ~~remove the css ans js from the view files~~
- add sort by field option
- load field titles directly from profile fields
- add a admin settings page to allow users to change the displayed fields and to change the sort order and pagesize
- add pagination option
