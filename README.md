# Description


Based on the core module directory
I've developed it for my personal use, if u want to change the fields displayed in the list u have to change it here:
https://github.com/bumrufus/humhub-modules-phonebook/blob/master/views/index/index.php

Sorry if it's not perfectly developed, but this is my first module :-)

TODOS:
cleanup the mess :-)
remove the css ans js from the view files 
add sort by field option
load field titles directly from profile fields
add a admin settings page to allow users to change the displayed fields and to change the sort order and pagesize
add pagination option
